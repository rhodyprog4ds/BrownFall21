# Grading Policies

## Late Work

````{margin}
```{note}
You may visit office hours to discuss assignments that you did not complete on time to get feedback and check your own understanding, but they will not count toward skill demonstration.
```
````
Late assignments will not be graded.
Every skill will be assessed through more than one assignment, so missing assignments occasionally not necessarily hurt your grade. If you do not submit any assignments that cover a given skill, you may earn the level 2 achievement in that skill through a portfolio check, but you will not be able to earn the level 3 achievement in that skill.
If you submit work that is not complete, however, it will be assessed and receive feedback. Submitting pseudocode or code with errors and comments about what you have tried could earn a level 1 achievement.  Additionally, most assignments cover multiple skills, so partially completing the assignment may earn level 2 for one, but not all.  Submitting *something* even if it is not perfect is important to keeping conversation open and getting feedback and help continuously.  


Building your Data Science Portfolio should be an ongoing process, where you commit work to your portfolio frequently. If something comes up and you cannot finish all that you would like assessed by the deadline, open an `Extension Request` issue on your repository.

In this issue, include:
1. A new deadline proposal
1. What additional work you plan to add
1. Why the extension is important to your learning
1. Why the extension will not hinder your ability to complete the next assignment on time.

This request should be no more than 7 sentences.


Portfolio due dates will be announced well in advance and prompts for it will be released weekly.  You should spend some time working on it each week, applying what you've learned so far, from the feedback on previous assignments.  


## Regrading

Re-request a review on your Feedback Pull request.  

For general questions, post on the conversation tab of your Feedback PR with your request.

For specific questions, reply to a specifc comment.

If you think we missed *where* you did something, add a comment on that line
(on the code tab of the PR, click the plus (+) next to the line) and then post
on the conversation tab with an overview of what you're requestion and tag @brownsarahm

## Best for loading directly into a notebook
- [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data) inside the folder for each year there is a README file with list of the datasets. These are .csv files
- [Json Datasets](https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets)
- [National Center for Education Statistics Digest 2019](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d19/tables_3.asp) These data tables are available for download as excel and visible on the page.
- Lots of wikipedia pages have tables in them.


## General Sources

These may require some more work

- [Stackoverflow Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) This data comes with readme info all packaged together in a .zip. You'll need to unzip it first.
- [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) most Kaggle datasets will require you to download and unzip them first and then you can copy them into your repo folder.
- [UCI Data Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
- [A curated list of datasets by task](https://www.springboard.com/blog/data-science/15-fun-datasets-to-analyze/) It includes datasets for cleaning, visualization, machine learning, and "data analysis" which would align with EDA in this course.

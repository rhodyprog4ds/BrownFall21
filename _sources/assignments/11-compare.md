## Assessment

```{list-table} compare models and make a recommendation
:header-rows: 1

* - task
  - skill
* - determine the best model for a given dataset
  - compare (2)
* - test the model on test data and interpret in context
  - classification, clustering, OR regression (2)
* - choose and justify appropriate parameters parameter grid for the context
  - classification, clustering, OR regression (2) AND process (2)
* - evaluate fit of the model while varying the cross validation parameters and interpret
  - evaluate (2)
* - interpret the classifier performance in the context of the dataset
  - process (2)
* - analyze the impact of model parameters on model performance
  - process (2)
* - usse EDA techniques to interpret the experimental results
  - summarize (2), visualize (2)
```

Choose a dataset, it can be appropriate for classification, regression, or clustering. Fit at least two models for the same task and choose the appropriate metrics to compare the fit. Decide which model you would recommend based on a realistic setting for that dataset and include evidence justifying that choice. Summarize your findings with plots and tables as appropriate.

This will be easiest if you use a dataset you've used on for one of the previous assignments or choose another.

How would this decision making compare for a more complex model or in more realistic setting.

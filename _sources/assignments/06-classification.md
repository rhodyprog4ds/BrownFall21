# Assignment 6: Understanding Classification

{{accept_assignment}}
__Due: {{ date }}__

```{list-table} demonstrate understanding of classification as a tasks and how to evaluate them
:header-rows: 1

* - task
  - skill
* - fit a naive bayes classifier
  - classification (1)
* - explain when the model works/does not and what to use to investigate
  - classification (2)
* - evaluate the performance of a classifier
  - evaluate (1)
```

## Naive Bayes Classification

For each dataset, answer the following:

1. Do you expect Gaussian Naive Bayes to work well on this dataset, why or why not?

    - think about the assumptions of naive bayes and classification in general)
    - _explanation is essential here, because you can actually use the classifier to check_
1. How well does a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier work on this dataset?

    - check the overall performance

1. How does the actual performance compare to your prediction?  If it performs much better or much worse than you expected, what might you use to figure out why?

```{tip}
_you do not have to figure out why your predictions were not correct, just list tools you've learned in class that might help you figure that out_
```

```{admonition} Think ahead

Do you think a different classifier might work better or do you think this data cannot be predicted any better than this?

    - check  the type of errors
    - are the errors random or are some errors more common than others?
```

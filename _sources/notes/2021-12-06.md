# Review, IDEA, & Preparing for Deep Learning

## Review for Level 1

Remember that to earn a C or better (or for you level 2 achievements to influence)
your grade at all you have to earn all of the level 1s.

Review the {ref}`achievement-definitions` to be sure you know what we are looking for.

## Representation


We change the representation of data when it is not tabular. As we've seen with
text and images, we have to transform the data into a tabular form for the
algorithms we have seen so far.  Deep learning combines learning a representation
with learning a prediciton rule.  


## Matching Tools to Steps in the ML Pipeline

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 0

* - pandas
  - loading data, cleaning data, summarizing
* - seaborn
  - visualization
* - BeautifulSoup
  - webscraping
* - sklearn
  - fitting models, evaluating models, tranforming data for modeling

```


## Deep Learning Ecosystem

While `sklearn` can do basic neural networks, it doesn't have many types of neurons or fancy layers.  

What makes deep learning work is its ability to transform data in new ways.  We
will see them in more det


Two popular Deep Learning Libraries are [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
([code](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)) and
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) ([code](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/v2.7.0)), both are open source
These are both complex, high performance libraries with optimized code.  We have
used python in class because it is a user-friendly programming language, but it
is not optimal, performance-wise, so much of the code in these libraries is in
C++.

[Keras](https://keras.io/) is a high level library written on top of tensorflow
in python. The goal of this library is to enable fast experimentation. You can
think of the relationship between `tensorflow` and `keras` like the relationship
between `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.  
In `seaborn` we got high level plot figures with high level parameters like using variables
in our dataset to create rows and columns of subplots.  In `matplotlib`, we would
have to separately create the subplot grid, then break the data apart, and
assign a plot using a subset of the data for each subplot. However, under the
hood, `seaborn` uses `matplotlib.` Just as we have mostly used seaborn, but occasionally use matplotlib to tweak things, we will use `keras`.  

````{margin}
```{note}
Note however that the relationship
here is soemwhat different, as keras is actually a submodule of tensorflow.  
Technically, the relationship is probably closer to `matplotlib` as a whole to
`matplotlib.pyplot`, but we have not used base matplotlib at all.
```
````

Deep learning is computationally expensive, which is why the code is so optimized.
However this means installing deep learning libraries is harder. They require
more dependencies than we have worked with to date.  Also, the code is optimized
in order to work on high performance hardware: GPUs and other parallel computing
systems, which most laptops do not have.  We will use [google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to do deep learning in class.


```{warning}
There is a whole semester long course on just Deep Learning (CSC541).  We will
not cover everything; the goal is just enough that you know where to start.  
If you want to use deep learning after this class alone, you'll need to study
substantially on your own, but past students have taken this foundation and made
it work.
```

## IDEA

The IDEA feedback is important feedback for helping Faculty, Departments, and
URI at large monitor how we are doing at teaching.  Filling out this feedback
is important, even though it does not impact your time in this class.  You fill
it out to help future students in this class and help instructors improve our
overall teaching, and you could see any of us again.

[IDEA Feedback]( https://uri.campuslabs.com/eval-home/ )

```{important}
If the class gets to 70% response rate, you'll all be allowed to reply to portfolio 4 feedback and change earn achievements you were close on but didn't quite get. (whatever number is appropriate; sitll a deadline on 12/22, so you'll get ~24 hours to reply & change your grade )
```


## More Practice

```{important}
these questions will help you be prepared for questions to earn the last few
achievments in class time.
```


1. What questions would you like to ask a Data scientist about how they do their work? Brin questions to the last two classes for our speakers (see bios from Prismia on 12/3).
1. How do different machine learning tasks (classification, regression, clustering) compare?
1. How do different models within a task compare?
1. What can your model's performance tell you?
1. Pick an ML applicaiton and think about what data, and tools you would need to use in order to replicate the system.
1. Review the import cells in different classes and be sure you know why we import each package, module, class, and function
1. What does each part of the output of a `GridSearchCV` experiment tell you?

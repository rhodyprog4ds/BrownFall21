# ML Task Review and Cross Validation

## Relationship between Tasks

We learned classification first, because it shares similarities with each
regression and clustering, while regression and clustering have less in common.

Classification is supervised learning for a categorical target.  
Regression is supervised learning for a continuous target.
Clustering is unsupervised learning for a categorical target.


Sklearn provides a nice flow chart for thinking through this.  

![estimator flow chart](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/_static/ml_map.png)

Predicting a category is another way of saying categorical target. Predicting a
quantitiy is another way of saying continuous target. Having lables or not is
the difference between


The flowchart assumes you know what you want to do with data and that is the
ideal scenario. You have a dataset and you have a goal.
For the purpose of getting to practice with a variety of things, in this course
we ask you to start with a task and then find a dataset. Assignment 9 is the
last time that's true however. Starting with Assignment 10 and the last
portflios, you can choose and focus on a specific application domain and then
choose the right task from there.  


Thinking about this, however, you use this information to move between the tasks
within a given type of data.
For example, you can use the same data for clustering as you did for classification.
Switching the task changes the questions though: classification evaluation tells
us how separable the classes are given that classifiers decision rule. Clustering
can find other subgroups or the same ones, so the evaluation we choose allows us
to explore this in more ways.

Regression requires a continuous target, so we need a dataset to be suitable for
that, we can't transform from the classification dataset to a regression one.  
However, we can go the other way and that's how some classification datasets are
created.

The UCI [adult](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult) Dataset is a popular ML dataset that was dervied from census
data. The goal is to use a variety of features to predict if a person makes
more than $50k per year or not. While income is a continuous value, they applied
a threshold ($50k) to it to make a binary variable. The dataset does not include
income in dollars, only the binary indicator.  


```{admonition} Further Reading
Recent work reconsturcted the dataset with the continuous valued income.
Their [repository](https://github.com/zykls/folktables) contains the data as well
as links to their paper and a video of their talk on it.

## Cross Validation

This week our goal is to learn how to optmize models. The first step in that is
to get a good estimate of its performance.  

We have seen that the test train splits, which are random, influence the
performance.
```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
from sklearn import tree
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn import metrics
```

We'll use the Iris data with a decision tree.
```{code-cell} ipython3
iris_df = sns.load_dataset('iris')

iris_X = iris_df.drop(columns=['species'])
iris_y = iris_df['species']
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
dt =tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()
```

We can split the data, fit the model, then compute a score, but since the
splitting is a randomized step, the score is a random variable.

For example, if we have a coin that we want to see if it's fair or not. We would
flip it to test.  One flip doesn't tell us, but if we flip it a few times, we
can estimate the probability it is heads by counting how many of the flips are
heads and dividing by how many flips.  

We can do something similar with our model performance. We can split the data
a bunch of times and compute the score each time.

`cross_val_score` does this all for us.

It takes an estimator object and the data.

By default it uses 5-fold cross validation. It splits the data into 5 sections,
then uses 4 of them to train and one to test. It then iterates through so that
each section gets used for testing.

```{code-cell} ipython3
cross_val_score(dt,iris_X,iris_y,)
```

We get back a score for each section or "fold" of the data. We can average those
to get a single estimate.

```{code-cell} ipython3
np.mean(cross_val_score(dt,iris_X,iris_y,))
```

We can use more folds.

```{code-cell} ipython3
cross_val_score(dt,iris_X,iris_y,cv=10)
```

```{admonition} Try it yourself
What is the equivalent `train_size` for 5 fold? what about 10-fold?
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
np.mean(cross_val_score(dt,iris_X,iris_y,cv=10))
```

We can use *any* estimator object here.
```{code-cell} ipython3
km = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
cross_val_score(km,iris_X,)
```

## Notes

1. Assignments 9 assesses up to level 2 for classification
1. Heads up: Assignment 10 and 11 ask you to explore your work from 2 of (7,8,9) by optimizing the parameter and comparing different models for the same task.  So
the dataset selection problem is going away, little by little.

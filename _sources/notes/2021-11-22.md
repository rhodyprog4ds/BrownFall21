# add an entry to the following dictionary with a name as the key and a sentence as the value
# share a sentence about how you're doing this week

# You can remain anonymous (this page & the notes will be fully public)
# by attributing it to a celebrity or psuedonym, but include *some* sort of attribution

How can we analyze these? All of the machine leanring models we have seen only use numerical features organized into a table with one row per samplea and one column per feature.

That's actually generally true.  ALl ML models require numerical features, at some point. The process of taking data that is not numerical and tabular, which is called unstrucutred, into strucutred (tabular) format we require is called feature extraction.  There are many, many ways to do that.  We'll see a few over the course of the rest of the semester.  Some more advanced models hide the feature extraction, by putting it in the same function, but it's always there.

## Terms


- document: unit of text we’re analyzing (one sample)
- token: sequence of characters in some particular document that are grouped together as a useful semantic unit for processing (basically a word)
- stop words: no meaning, we don’t need them (like a, the, an,). Note that this is context dependent
- dictionary: all of the possible words that a given system knows how to process

We'll start by taking out one sentence and anlyzeing that:
```{code-cell} ipython3
s1 = sentence_dict['Professor Brown']

s1
```

## Bag of Words Representionat

We're going to learn a represetnation called the bag of words.  It ignores the order of the words within a document. To do this, we'll first extract all of the tokens (tokenize) the docuemtns and then count how mnay times each word appears.  This will be our numerical representation of the data.  

````{margin}
```{admonition} Further Reading
[Transformers](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/data_transforms.html) are another broad class of sklearn objects.  We've seen Estimators mostly so far.
We're focusing on the [text feature extraction](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html#text-feature-extraction) for now.
```
````
Then we initialize our transformer

```{code-cell} ipython3
counts = CountVectorizer()
```

We can use the fit transform method to fit the vectorizer model and apply it to this sentence.
```{code-cell} ipython3
counts.fit_transform([s1])
```
To see the output better, we use the toarray method.
```{code-cell} ipython3
counts.fit_transform([s1]).toarray()
```

We can also examine attributes of the object.
````{margin}
```{tip}
Notice that we keep using the same tools over and over to explore how things work.  You can do this on your own, when you're learning new things. Example
code is readily available online but not all of it is well documented or
clearly explained.

Also, in a job, much, much, more of your time will be spent reading code than writing code from scratch. These strategies will help you get familiar with a new code base and get up to speed faster.
```
````
```{code-cell} ipython3
counts.vocabulary_
```

We see that what it does is creates an ordered (the values are the order) list of words as the parameters of this model (ending in `_` is an attribute of the object or parameter of the model)

```{admonition} Try it yourself
What other model parameters have we seen? How have we used model parameters in the past?
```

To see what happens a bit more, let's add a second senntence.
```{code-cell} ipython3
s2 = sentence_dict['Kang Liu']
s2
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
counts.fit_transform([s1,s2])
counts.vocabulary_
```

Now we can see that it puts the words in the `vocabulary_` attribute (aka the {term}`dictionary`) in alphabetical order.

```{code-cell} ipython3
counts.fit_transform([s1,s2]).toarray()
```
From this we can see that the representation is the count of how many times each word appears.

Now we can apply it to all of the sentences, or our whole {term}`corpus`

```{code-cell} ipython3
mat = counts.fit_transform(sentence_dict.values()).toarray()
mat
```

We can get the dictionary out in order using the `get_feature_names` method. This method has a generic name, not specific to text, because it's a property of transformers in general.
```{code-cell} ipython3
counts.get_feature_names()
```

We can use a dataframe again to see this more easily. We can put labels on both the index and the column headings.
```{code-cell} ipython3
sentence_df = pd.DataFrame(data = mat, columns =counts.get_feature_names(),
                          index=sentence_dict.keys())

sentence_df
```

## How can we find the most commonly used word?

One guess
```{code-cell} ipython3
sentence_df.max()
```
This is the maximum number of times each word appears in single "document", but it's also not sorted, it's alphabetical.

This shows the word that appears the most times.:
```{code-cell} ipython3
sentence_df.max().sort_values()
```


To get what we want we need to sum, which by default is along the columns, or per word.
```{code-cell} ipython3
sentence_df.sum()
```
Agaain it's unsorted, but we can apply max

```{code-cell} ipython3
sentence_df.sum().max
```
this gives only t the value though, we want the word. When we summed we got back a Series with the words in the index:
```{code-cell} ipython3
sentence_df.sum().index
```
So we can use idxmax

```{code-cell} ipython3
sentence_df.sum().idxmax()
```



## Distances in text
We can now use a distance function to calculate how far apaart the different sentences are.

```{code-cell} ipython3
euclidean_distances(sentence_df)
```

We can make this eaiser to read by making it a Data Frame.
```{code-cell} ipython3
dist_df = pd.DataFrame(data = euclidean_distances(sentence_df),
            index= sentence_dict.keys(), columns= sentence_dict.keys())
dist_df
```

Who wrote the most similar question to me?

```{code-cell} ipython3
dist_df['Professor Brown'].drop('Professor Brown').idxmin()
```



## Questions After Classroom

### How can this be used for training a classifier?
```{toggle}
To train a classifier, we would also need target variables, but the `mat` variable we had above can be used as the `X` for any `sklearn` estimator object.
To train more complex tasks you would need appropriate data: for example labeled articles that are real and fake to train a fake news classifier (this is provided for a12).
```

### How are ram tokens tracked?

```{toggle}
Ram Tokens are tracked in the [Ram Token Bank: http://drsmb.co/ramtoken](http://drsmb.co/ramtoken) form.  You'll get e-mails when you earn or use them, however no one has submitted for any. You still can though (espeically if you were advised to and forgot).
```

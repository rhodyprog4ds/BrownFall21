# Clustering

```{code-cell} ipython3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import string
import pandas as pd
```

Clustering is unsupervised learning.  That means we do not have the labels to
learn from.  We aim to learn both the labels for each point and some way of
characterizing the classes at the same time.  

Computationally, this is a harder problem.  Mathematically, we can
typically solve problems when we have a number of equations equal to or greater
than the number of unknowns.  For $N$ data points ind $d$ dimensions and $K$ clusters, we have $N$
equations and $N + K*d$ unknowns. This means we have a harder problem to solve.

For today, we'll see K-means clustering which is defined by $K$ a number of
clusters and a mean (center) for each one.  There are other K-centers algorithms
for other types of centers.


## How does Kmeans work?

We will start with some synthetics data and then see how the clustering works.

```{code-cell} ipython3
C = 4
N = 200
classes = list(string.ascii_uppercase[:C])
mu = {c: i for c, i in zip(classes,[[2,2], [6,6], [2,6],[6,2]])}
sigma = {c: i*.5 for c, i in zip(classes,np.random.random(4))}
sigma

target5 = np.random.choice(classes,N)
data5 = [np.random.multivariate_normal(mu[c],.25*np.eye(2)) for c in target5]
df5 = pd.DataFrame(data = data5,columns = ['x' + str(i) for i in range(2)]).round(2)

df5['char'] = target5

sns.pairplot(data =df5, hue='char')
```

First, we'll pick just the data columns.
```{code-cell} ipython3
df = df5[['x0','x1']]
df.head()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.scatterplot(data=df,x='x0',y='x1')
```

Next, we'll pick 4 random points to be the starting points as the means.

```{code-cell} ipython3
K = 4
mu0 = df.sample(n=K).values
mu0
```

Now, we will compute, fo each sample which of those four points it is closest to
first by taking the difference, squaring it, then summing along each row.
```{code-cell} ipython3
[((df-mu_i)**2).sum(axis=1) for mu_i in mu0]
```
This gives us a list of 4 data DataFrames, one for each mean (mu), with one row
for each point in the dataset with the distance from that point to the
corresponding mean. We can stack these into one DataFrame.


```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.concat([((df-mu_i)**2).sum(axis=1) for mu_i in mu0],axis=1).head()
```
Now we have one row per sample and one column per mean, with with the distance from that point to the mean. What we want is to calculate the assignment, which
mean is closest, for each point.  Using `idxmin` with `axis=1` we take the
minimum across each row and returns the index (location) of that minimum.

```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.concat([((df-mu_i)**2).sum(axis=1) for mu_i in mu0],axis=1).idxmin(axis=1).head()
```

We'll save all of this in a column named `'0'`. Since it is our 0th iteration.

```{code-cell} ipython3
df['0'] = pd.concat([((df-mu_i)**2).sum(axis=1) for mu_i in mu0],axis=1).idxmin(axis=1)

df.head()
```


Here, we'll set up some helper code.
````{margin}
```{adomonition} Further Reading
For more on [color palettes](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.color_palette.html) see the seaborn docs
```
````
```{code-cell} ipython3
data_cols = ['x0','x1']
def mu_to_df(mu,i):
    mu_df = pd.DataFrame(mu,columns=data_cols)
    mu_df['iteration'] = str(i)
    mu_df['class'] = ['M'+str(i) for i in range(K)]
    mu_df['type'] = 'mu'
    return mu_df

# color maps, we select every other value from this palette that has 8 values & is paird
cmap_pt = sns.color_palette('tab20',8)[1::2] # starting from 1
cmap_mu = sns.color_palette('tab20',8)[0::2] # starting form 0
```

Now we can plot the data, save the axis, and plot the means on top of that.
Seaborn plotting functions return an axis, by saving that to a variable, we
can pass it to the `ax` parameter of another plotting function so that both
plotting functions go on the same figure.

```{code-cell} ipython3
sfig = sns.scatterplot(data=df,x='x0',y='x1', hue='0',
                       palette =cmap_pt,legend=False)
mu_df = mu_to_df(mu0,0)
sns.scatterplot(data=mu_df, x='x0',y='x1',hue='class',
                palette=cmap_mu,legend=False, ax=sfig)
```

We see that each point is assigned to the lighter shade of its matching mean.
These points are the one that is closest to each point, but they're not the
centers of the point clouds.
Now, we can compute new means of the points assigned to each cluster, using
groupby.

```{code-cell} ipython3
mu1 = df.groupby('0')[data_cols].mean().values
mu1
```

We can plot these again, the same data, but with the new means.
```{code-cell} ipython3
sfig = sns.scatterplot(data=df,x='x0',y='x1', hue='0',
                       palette =cmap_pt,legend=False)
mu_df = mu_to_df(mu1,0)
sns.scatterplot(data=mu_df, x='x0',y='x1',hue='class',
                palette=cmap_mu,legend=False, ax=sfig)
```

We see that now the means are in the center of each cluster, but that there are
now points in one color that are assigned to other clusters.

So, again we can update the assignments.

```{code-cell} ipython3
df['1'] = pd.concat([((df[data_cols]-mu_i)**2).sum(axis=1) for mu_i in mu1],axis=1).idxmin(axis=1)
```
And plot again.
```{code-cell} ipython3
sfig = sns.scatterplot(data=df,x='x0',y='x1', hue='0',
                       palette =cmap_pt,legend=False)
mu_df = mu_to_df(mu,0)
sns.scatterplot(data=mu_df, x='x0',y='x1',hue='class',
                palette=cmap_mu,legend=False, ax=sfig)
```
If we keep going back and forth like this, eventually, the assignment step will
not change any assignments. We call this condition convergence. We can
implement the algorithm with a while loop.

```{admonition} Correction
In the following I swapped the order of the mean update and assignment steps.  
My previous version had a different *initialization* (the above part) so it
was okay for the steps to be in the other order.
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
i =1
mu_list = [mu_to_df(mu0,i), mu_to_df(mu1,i)]
cur_old = str(i-1)
cur_new = str(i)
while sum(df[cur_old] !=df[cur_new]) >0:
    cur_old = cur_new
    i +=1
    cur_new = str(i)
        #     update the means and plot with current generating assignments
    mu = df.groupby(cur_old)[data_cols].mean().values
    mu_df = mu_to_df(mu,i)
    mu_list.append(mu_df)

    fig = plt.figure()
    sfig = sns.scatterplot(data =df,x='x0',y='x1',hue=cur_old,palette=cmap_pt,legend=False)
    sns.scatterplot(data =mu_df,x='x0',y='x1',hue='class',palette=cmap_mu,ax=sfig,legend=False)


    #     update the assigments and plot with the associated means
    df[cur_new] = pd.concat([((df[data_cols]-mu_i)**2).sum(axis=1) for mu_i in mu],axis=1).idxmin(axis=1)
    fig = plt.figure()
    sfig = sns.scatterplot(data =df,x='x0',y='x1',hue=cur_new,palette=cmap_pt,legend=False)
    sns.scatterplot(data =mu_df,x='x0',y='x1',hue='class',palette=cmap_mu,ax=sfig,legend=False)


n_iter = i
```

This algorithm is random.  So each time we run it, it looks a little different.

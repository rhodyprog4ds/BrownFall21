# Exploratory Data Analysis


```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
sns.set_theme(palette= "colorblind")
```


```{code-cell} ipython3
arabica_data_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database/master/data/arabica_data_cleaned.csv'

coffee_df = pd.read_csv(arabica_data_url)
```

Which of the following scores is distributed most similarly to Sweetness?


```{code-cell} ipython3
scores_of_interest = ['Flavor','Balance','Aroma','Body',
                      'Uniformity','Aftertaste','Sweetness']
```

First step is to subset the data:
```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df[scores_of_interest].head(2)
```

Then we produce a kde plot  
```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df[scores_of_interest].plot(kind='kde')
```

We could also do it with seaborn
```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.displot(data=coffee_df[scores_of_interest],kind='kde')
```

If we forget the parameter `kind`, we get its default value,
which is histogram

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["hide-input"]
print('\n'.join(sns.displot.__doc__.split('\n')[5:10]))
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.displot(data=coffee_df[scores_of_interest])
```

## Summarizing with two variables

So, we can summarize data now, but the summaries we have done so far have treated each variable one at a time.  The most interesting patterns are in often in how multiple variables interact. We'll do some modeling that looks at multivariate functions of data in a few weeks, but for now, we do a little more with summary statistics.

On Monday, we saw how to see how many reviews there were per country, using `value_counts()` on the `Country.of.Origin` column.

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Country.of.Origin'].value_counts().head(2)
```

The data also has `Number.of.Bags` however.  How can we check which has the most bags?

We can do this with groupby.

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.groupby('Country.of.Origin')['Number.of.Bags'].sum()
```


What just happened?
![split-apply-combine image showing one data table, it split into 3 part, the sum applied to each part, and the sums combined back into one table](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/figures/03.08-split-apply-combine.png)

Groupby splits the whole dataframe into parts where each part has the same value for `Country.of.Origin` and then after that, we extracted the `Number.of.Bags` column, took the sum (within each separate group) and then put it all back together in one table (in this case, a `Series` becuase we picked one variable out)

## How doe Groupby Work?

We can view this by saving the groupby object as a variable and exploring it.


```{code-cell} ipython3
country_grouped = coffee_df.groupby('Country.of.Origin')

country_grouped
```

Trying to look at it without applying additional functions, just tells us the type.  But, it's iterable, so we can loop over.


```{code-cell} ipython3
for country,df in country_grouped:
    print(type(country), type(df))
```

I used this feature to build the separate view of the communication channels on this website.  You can view that source using the github icon on that page.

````

We could manually compute things using the data structure, if needed, though using pandas functionality will usually do what we want. For example:

````{margin}
```{note}
I tried putting this dictionary into the dataframe for display purposes using the regular constructor and got an error, so I googled about making one from a dictionary to get the docs, which is how I learned about the [`from_dict`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.from_dict.html) method and its `orient` parameter which solved my problems.
```
````

```{code-cell} ipython3
bag_total_dict = {}

for country,df in country_grouped:
    tot_bags =  df['Number.of.Bags'].sum()
    bag_total_dict[country] = tot_bags

pd.DataFrame.from_dict(bag_total_dict, orient='index',
                           columns = ['Number.of.Bags.Sum'])
```

is the same as what we did before

```{admonition} Question from class
How can we sort it?
```

First, we'll make it a variable to keep the code legible, then we'll use `sort_values()`

```{code-cell} ipython3
bag_total_df = coffee_df.groupby('Country.of.Origin')['Number.of.Bags'].sum()
bag_total_df.sort_values()
```

Which, by default uses ascending order, the method has an `ascending` parameter and its default value is `True`, so we can switch it to `False` to get descending

```{code-cell} ipython3
bag_total_df.sort_values(ascending=False,)
```

## Customizing Data Summaries

We've looked at an overall summary with `describe` on all the variables,  describe on one variable, individual statistics on all variables, and individual statistics on one variable.  We can also build  summaries of multiple varialbes with a custom subset of summary statistics, with `aggregate` or using its alias `agg`

```{admonition} Learning Tip
When a person reads a line of code, they have to use their working memory to hold the whole thing in order to make sense of it. Human working memory only holds 5-9 things at a time, that's why a phone number is 7 digits without the area code, (when people used to have to actually dial the digits, they also didn't need the area codes for short-distance calls, which were most of the calls).   

How many concepts does a person have to hold in working memory at once to parse the second version?

If you are writing the code, and building it up, you hold the previous pieces in your memory differently than a person coming to it for the first time.
```
`````

```{code-cell} ipython3
country_grouped.agg({'Number.of.Bags':'sum',
                     'Balance':['mean','count'],})
```


We could also string this together, but splitting into interim variables makes code more readable. Shorter lines are easier to read (and sometimes auto-enforced on projects). Also, by giving a good variable name to the interim states we get more description, which can help a human better read it.  


```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.groupby('Country.of.Origin').agg({'Number.of.Bags':'sum','Balance':['mean','count'],})
```



```{admonition} Question from Class
What does the `count` do? or how can we figure it out?
```


```{adomonition} Learning Tip
To see what a method does, reading the documentation for a method should generally be your first stop. Testing it yourself is best for when you are trying to see how two methods are different. Once you're testing, one way is to apply it to a small dataset. In fact, a lot of the pandas documentation illustrates how methods work on tiny dataframes.
```

In this case, let's compare `count` to `shape` we know that shape returns the number of rows and columns. Also `shape` is an attribute, not a method (so no `()` for shape). However, there's a more important difference.  

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Balance','Farm.Name','Lot.Number'].shape
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Balance','Farm.Name','Lot.Number'].count()
```
Here we get different number for `Balance` and `Farm Name`
The shape tells us how many rows there are, while count tells us how many are not null.

We can verify visually that some are null with:
```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.head()
```


```{admonition} Correction
This response is slightly corrected from what I said in class, because in the balance column, it does match, but in general it doesn't. `count` on grouped will only be the same as `value_count` when `count` is applied to a column that does not have any missing values where the grouping variable has a value.
```

On the balance column alone in class, we checked that the grouped count matched the country value counts.

```{code-cell} ipython3
country_grouped[['Balance','Farm.Name','Lot.Number']].count().sort_values(by='Balance'
    ascending=False)
```


```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Country.of.Origin'].value_counts()
```

In class, they were the same, because `Balance` doesn't have missing values. `Farm.Name` and `Lot.Number` havea lot of missing values, so they're different numbers.


Another function we could use when we first examine a dataset is `info` this tells us about the NaN values up front.
```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.info()
```


## Using summaries for visualization

```{important}
This section is an extension, that we didn't get to in class, but might help in your assignment
```

For example, we can group by color and take the mean of each of the scores from the beginning of class and then use a bar chart.

```{code-cell} ipython3
color_grouped = coffee_df.groupby('Color')[scores_of_interest].mean()
color_grouped.plot(kind='bar')
```

## Questions after class

```{admonition} Ram Token Opportunity
add a question with a pull request; earn 1-2 ram tokens for submitting a question with the answer (with sources)
```

## More Practice

- Make a table thats total number of bags and mean and count of scored for each of the variables in the `scores_of_interest` list.
- Make a bar chart of the mean score for each variable `scores_of_interest` grouped by country.

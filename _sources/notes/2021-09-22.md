# Visualization

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
sns.set_theme(palette= "colorblind")
```

## Jupyter FAQ
```{admonition} Question from class
Why doesn't my jupyter print things out that are on the last line?
```

Whem we create a variable and then put that on the last line of a cell, jupyter
displays it.

```{code-cell} ipython3
name = 'sarah'
name
```

How it diplsays it depends on the type

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(name)
```

For a string, it uses `print`

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(name)
```

so this and the one above look the same.  For objects that have a `_repr_html_`
method, juypter uses that, and uses html to render the object in a more visually
appealing way.


## Review of describe
we're going to work with the arabica data today, because it's a little bigger
and more interesting for plotting

```{code-cell} ipython3
arabica_data_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database/master/data/arabica_data_cleaned.csv'

coffee_df = pd.read_csv(arabica_data_url)
```

We can describe it again, to see it has mostly the same variables we saw before,
but some different as well.

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.describe()
```

```{admonition} Question from class
Why do we need the `()` on the describe but not on just the data
```

As is often the case, again this comes back to the type.

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(coffee_df)
```

is a data frame which has the  `_repr_html_` method

````{margin}
```{note}
notice that this one has the ... in the columns and rows directions.
```
```{admonition} Try it Yourself
what can you check in a dataFrame to predict if it will display with or without
the ...?
```
````

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df
```

so it prints nicely as tdid the `coffee_df.describe()`

If we leave the `()` off we don't get nice formatting

````{margin}
```{hint}
when objects do not have the `_repr_html_` method their output includes the type
```
````

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.describe
```

so lets check the type of that.

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(coffee_df.describe)
```

it's a `bound method` or a function that *will* be applied to the DataFrame, but
we didn't actually run the method.  To see that it hasn't run, we can use an
ipython[^ipy] [magic `%%timeit`](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#magic-timeit)

[^ipy]: the kernel of python we're using

````{margin}
```{admonition} Further reading
The [magic functions](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#)
can be defined for a cell or a line.
[Timeit](https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html)
is actually a standard python library that you can call on the command line or in a python
script as well, but juypter, by way of ipython gives us easy access to it with
nice defaults.
```
````

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%timeit
coffee_df.describe
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%timeit
coffee_df.describe()
```

Note that without the `()` it runs much much faster, signaling that it did less
finding the method, is less calcuation than computing statistics on the data

## Basic plots in pandas


Pandas gives us basic plots.
```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Flavor'].plot()
```
Since we chose a series, it plotted that data as line vs the index.

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.index
```

We can change the kind, for example to a [Kernel Density Estimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation).
This approximates the distribution of the data, you can think of it rougly like
a smoothed out histogram.
```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Flavor'].plot(kind='kde')
```

We can also plot two variables as a scatter plot, by specifying the `x`, `y` and
`kind`
```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.plot(x='Flavor',y='Balance', kind='scatter')
```

Let's Make a histogram plot of the Balance variable

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Balance'].plot(kind='hist')
```

```{admonition} Question from class
Can we plot two histograms with `coffee_df['Balance']['Flavor'].plot(kind='hist')`
```
```{code-cell} ipython3

:tags: ["raises-exception"]

coffee_df['Balance']['Flavor'].plot(kind='hist')
```

Let's break down why that errors.  When we append things to the left, python
interprets them by passing the output of one step to the input of the next one.  
So `coffee_df['Balance'].plot(kind='hist')` first made a series, then plotted it.
In the above, we again got the series, which works

````{margin}
```{note}
Since I know these will be DataFrames, I'm appending the `head()` method to
reduce the output for presenation.
```
````
```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Balance'].head(2)
```
But then, we tried to index it with 'Flavor', but we don't have that any more

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Balance']['Flavor']
```
So  we get a key error and we know this is the part of the line we have to change.


We need to index into the DataFrame and pick two columns at once. When we index,
we can use the name of a variable as a string or a list.  We can buil this list
on the fly and python exectues fromt he inside out.  
The outer `[ ]` index and the inner `[ ]` make alist

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df[['Balance','Flavor']].head(2)
```

we could also build the list first, then index for readability
```{code-cell} ipython3
hist_vars = ['Balance','Flavor'].head(2)
coffee_df[hist_vars]
```

This gives us a data frame, which we can plot.
```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df[['Balance','Flavor']].plot(kind='hist')
```
We'll see ways to improve this on Friday.

## Plotting in Python

- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): low level plotting tools
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html): high level plotting with opinionated defaults
- [ggplot](https://yhat.github.io/ggpy/): plotting based on the ggplot library in R.


Pandas and seaborn use matplotlib under the hood.

````{margin}
```{admonition}  Think Ahead
Learning ggplot is a way to earn level 3 for visualize
```
````
Seaborn and ggplot both assume the data is set up as a DataFrame.
Getting started with seaborn is the simplest, so we'll use that.



We can get that basic plot back.
```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.scatterplot(data=coffee_df,x='Flavor',y='Balance')
```

But now we have more power to investigate more relationships in the data.

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.scatterplot(data=coffee_df,x='Flavor',y='Balance',hue='Color')
```
 From this we can see that the color doesn't appear to be related to the flavor
 or balance scores, but that the flavor and balacne are related.

We can also break this apart. `lmplot` is a higher level plotting function so
it allows us to create grids of plots and by default also includes a regression
line. We'll turn that off for now, with `,fit_reg=False`.
```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.lmplot(data=coffee_df,x='Flavor',y='Balance',hue='Color',
               col='Color',fit_reg=False)
```
`col` stands for column.  We can also use `row`

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.lmplot(data=coffee_df,x='Flavor',y='Balance',hue='Color',
               row='Color')
```

We can also use both together:

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.lmplot(data=coffee_df,x='Flavor',y='Balance',hue='Color',
               row='Color',col='Variety')
```

How could we choose which countries to select to make this not show the ones
with very few points?
```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Country.of.Origin'].value_counts()
```
 Or we can focus on the countried, but wrap them.

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.lmplot(data=coffee_df,x='Flavor',y='Balance',hue='Color',
               col='Country.of.Origin',col_wrap=5)
```

## Questions after class

```{admonition} Ram Token Opportunity
add a question with a pull request; earn 1-2 ram tokens for submitting a question with the answer (with sources)
```

## More practice

1. Plot the kde for the `Aftertaste`
1. How does `Total.Cup.Points` vary by `Certification.Body`
1. Are  moisture and sweetness related? Does that relationship vary by Color?

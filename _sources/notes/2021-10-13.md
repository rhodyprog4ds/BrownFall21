# Intro to Machine Learning 

+++


When we do machine learning, this can also be called:

data mining
pattern recognition
modeling


because we are looking for patterns in the data and typically then planning to

use those patterns to make predictions or automate a task.  



Each of these terms does have slightly different meanings and usage, but

someitmes they're used close to exchangeably.

A statistical model is a mathematical model that embodies a set of statistical assumptions concerning the generation of sample data (and similar data from a larger population). A statistical model represents, often in considerably idealized form, the data-generating process

We're going to appraoch machine learning from the perspective of modeling for

a few reasons:

model based machine learnining streamlines understanding the big picture
the model way of interpreting it aligns well with using sklearn
thinking in terms of models aligns with incorporating domain expertise, as in our data science definition


this paper by Christopher M. Bishop, a leading ML researcher who also wrote one of a the widely preferred

graduate level ML textbooks, details advantages of a model based perspective and

a more mathematical version of a model based approach to machine learning.

Starting from a dataset, we first make an additional designation about how we will use the different variables (columns). We will call most of them the features, which we denote mathematically with ﻿\mathbf{X}X﻿ and we'll choose one to be the target or labels, denoted by ﻿\mathbf{y}y﻿.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(GaussianNB)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(train_test_split)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
iris_df = sns.load_dataset('iris')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.pairplot(data=iris_df, hue='species')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
target = iris_df['species'].values
type(target)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
features = iris_df.values[:,:4]
features.shape
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, target,random_state=0)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
X_train.shape
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
X_test.shape
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
gnb = GaussianNB()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
gnb
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
gnb.__dict__
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
gnb.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3

```

```{code-cell} ipython3
y_pred = gnb.predict(X_test)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
y_pred
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
sum(y_pred == y_test)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
len(y_test)
```

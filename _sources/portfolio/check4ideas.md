# Check 4 Ideas

For Check 4, all of the prompts from check 1 &2 apply, plus the following additional
prompts.  

If you have other ideas, you can also ask and those are likely posible.  



## Organize your knowledge

Develop some sort of visual aid that demonstrates how you understand some aspect(s)
of data science working.  Think of this as something that future students could
use to help them learning, so assume prior knowledge topics covered earlier than the one
you are demonstrating.

This could be a concept map, a table that shows how you've traced how something
works or any other sort of conceptual tol that helps convey your understanding.


## Extend any assignment

Assignments 7-12 are most relevant because they leave room to extend and ask 
new questions.

If you both reflect on what you had trouble with and extend you could earn level
2 and 3.

## Try alternative libraries/ tools

One option for workflow level 3 is to use other data science skills and reflect
on how what we have learned so far helped you learn a new set of tool as an
alternative way to do things.

## Try feature engineering or representation learning

Try different transformations and see how they impact how well a model performs.
This could be using `sklearn.feature_extraction` tools or trying different
types of neural network layers at the beginning.

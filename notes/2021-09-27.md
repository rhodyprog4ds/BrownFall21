# Reshaping Data

Today, we'll begin reshaping data.  We'll  cover:
- filtering
- applying a function to all rows
- what is tidy data
- reshaping data into tidy data

First some setup:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns

sns.set_theme(font_scale=2)
arabica_data_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database/master/data/arabica_data_cleaned.csv'
```

## Cleaning Data
This week, we'll be cleaning data.

Cleaning data is labor intensive and requires making subjective choices.  
We'll focus on, and assess you on, manipulating data correctly, making reasonable
choices, and documenting the choices you make carefully.


We'll focus on the programming tools that get used in cleaning data in class

this week:
- reshaping data
- handling missing or incorrect values
- changing the representation of information

## Tidy Data

Read in the three csv files described below and store them in a list of DataFrames.

```{code-cell} ipython3
url_base = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhodyprog4ds/rhodyds/main/data/'

datasets = ['study_a.csv','study_b.csv','study_c.csv']
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
df_list = [pd.read_csv(url_base + file,na_values= '') for file in datasets]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
df_list[0]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
df_list[1]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
df_list[2]
```

These three all show the same data, but let's say we have two goals:
- find the average  effect per person across treatments
- find the average effect per treatment across people

This works differently for these three versions.

```{code-cell} ipython3
df_list[0].mean()
```
we get the average per treatment, but to get the average per person, we have to go across rows, which we can do here, but doesn't work as well with plotting
```{code-cell} ipython3
df_list[0].mean(axis=1)
```
and this is not well labeled.

Let's try the next one.
```{code-cell} ipython3
df_list[1].mean()
```
Now we get the average per person, but what about per treatment? again we have to go across rows instead.

```{code-cell} ipython3
df_list[1].mean(axis=1)
```

For the third one, however, we can use groupby
```{code-cell} ipython3
df_list[2].groupby('person').mean()
```


```{code-cell} ipython3
df_list[2].groupby('treatment').mean()
```

## Tidying Data


Let's reshape the first one to match the tidy one. First, we
will save it to a DataFrame, this makes things easier to read
and enables us to use the built in help in jupyter, because it can't check types too many levels into a data structure.
```{code-cell} ipython3
treat_df = df_list[0]
```

Let's look at it again, so we can see
```{code-cell} ipython3
treat_df.head()
```

```{admonition} Correction
I fixed the three data files so the spaces can be removed. You will need to
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
treat_df.melt(value_vars = ['treatmenta','treatmentb'],
             id_vars = ['name'],
             value_name = 'result', var_name = 'treatment' )
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
tidy_treat_df = treat_df.melt(value_vars = ['treatmenta','treatmentb'],
             id_vars = ['name'],
             value_name = 'result', var_name = 'treatment' )
```


```{code-cell} ipython3
tidy_treat_df.groupby('name').mean()
```

## Filtering Data by a column

Let's go back to the coffee dataset
```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df = pd.read_csv(arabica_data_url, index_col = 0)
coffee_df.head()
```

Recall on Friday we computed the total number of bags per country.
```{code-cell} ipython3
# compute total bags per country
bag_total_df = coffee_df.groupby('Country.of.Origin')['Number.of.Bags'].sum()
```

We can subset this to get only the countries with over 15000 using a boolean mask:

```{code-cell} ipython3
bag_total_df[bag_total_df>15000]
```

what we put in the `[]` has to be the same length and each element has to be boolean

```{code-cell} ipython3
len(bag_total_df>15000)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
mask = bag_total_df>15000
type(mask[0])
```

## Augmenting a dataset

We want the names of the countries as a list, so we extract the index of that series and then cast it to a list.
```{code-cell} ipython3
high_prod_countries =  list(bag_total_df[bag_total_df>15000].index)
```

Next we want to be able to check if a country is in this list, so we'll make a lambda that can do that
```{code-cell} ipython3
high_prod = lambda c: c in high_prod_countries
```

Recall, the `lambda` keyword makes a function

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(high_prod)
```

We can test it
```{code-cell} ipython3
high_prod('Mexico'), high_prod('Ethiopa')
```

Now, we can apply that lambda function to each country in our whole coffee data frame. and save that to a new DataFrame.
```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['high_production'] = coffee_df['Country.of.Origin'].apply(high_prod)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.head()
```


Finally, we can filter the whole data frame using that new column.
```{code-cell} ipython3
high_prod_coffee_df = coffee_df[coffee_df['high_production']]
```


```{admonition} Question from class
How can we get the ones not on that list?
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
low_prod_coffee_df = coffee_df[coffee_df['high_production']==False]
```

````{admonition} Try it Yourself

Replace the FIXMEs in the excerpt below to reshape the data to have a value column with the value of the score
and a Score column that indicates which score is in that . Keep the color and country as values

```
scores_of_interest = ['Balance','Aroma','Body','Aftertaste']
attrs_of_interest = ['Country.of.Origin','Color']
high_prod_coffee_df_melted = high_prod_coffee_df.melt(
        id_vars = FIXME,
        value_vars = FIXME,
        value_name = 'Value',
        var_name = 'Score')
```

so that it looks like the following
````


```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["hide-input"]

high_prod_coffee_df_melted = high_prod_coffee_df.melt(
        id_vars = ['Country.of.Origin','Color'],
        value_vars = ['Balance','Aroma','Body','Aftertaste'],
        value_name = 'Value',
        var_name = 'Score')

high_prod_coffee_df_melted.head()
```

```{admonition} Try it Yourself
Plot the distribution of each score on a separate subplot and use a different color for each country. Use a kde for the distributions.
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["hide-input"]

sns.displot(data = high_prod_coffee_df_melted, x ='Value', hue = 'Country.of.Origin',
            col = 'Score',col_wrap =2, aspect=1.5, kind = 'kde')

```

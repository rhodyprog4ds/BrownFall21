# Reveiwing Merges & Databases

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.merge?
```

**a review problem**

If `weather_df` has a row for every date in the past 100 years, a column named `date` and columns for the weather that day and `birthdays_df` has a row for each member of the CS department with a column `birthdate` and a second column name, how would you merge these two datasets to find out the weather on the day each person was born?


```
bday_weather = pd.merge(left= weather_df, right = birthdays_df,
                        left_on = 'date', right_on ='birthdate', how= 'inner')
```

## Working with Databases

Off the shelf, pandas cannot read databased by default. We'll use the [`sqlite3`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) library.
````{margin}
```{note}
[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) is a type of database.
```
````

```{code-cell} ipython3
import sqlite3
```

First, we set up a connection, that links the the notebook to the databse.

```{code-cell} ipython3
conn = sqlite3.connect('data/nba1819.db')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
conn
```

To use it, we add a cursor.
```{code-cell} ipython3
cursor = conn.cursor()
```

We can use execute to pass SQL queries through the cursor to the database.
```{code-cell} ipython3
cursor.execute('SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type="table"')
```

Then we use `fetchall` to get the the results of the query.
```{code-cell} ipython3
cursor.fetchall()
```

We can also pass queries to the database through pandas and then get it returned as a DataFrame.
```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.read_sql('SELECT PLAYER_ID, PLAYER_NAME FROM playerNames',conn).head(1)
```

We can use `*` to get all of the columns and `LIMIT` to reduce the number of rows.
```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM playerNames LIMIT 5',conn)
```


How can get all of the data from the teams table?
```{code-cell} ipython3
teams_df = pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM teams',conn)
teams_df.head()
```


<!--
```{code-cell} ipython3

``` -->

## More practice

For each of the following, think about what to query from the database and how to merge
the tables after.
Also, consider if these questions are all specific enough or require more decisions to be made.

1. How many players changed from the `East` conference to the `West` conference
during the 2018 season?
1. How many  from the `East` conference to the `West` conference
from the 2018 season to the 2019 season?
1. Did teams that were founded earlier have better records in the 2018 season?


```{admonition} Think ahead
For a portfolio, you could ask questions like do events in a city impact if the
home team wins later that week?

```
